This project was made for the Lede Data Journalism Program at Columbia University.

The goal was to apply the following techniques:

- **Data Collection:**  
  Scrape the Brazil Central Bank Website (XPath + Browser inspection)

- **Data Automation (R):**  
  Automate download for the over 100 zip files, as well as the unzipping, ingesting and cleaning process

- **Geocoding (R):**  
  Test the new geocodebr package on over 55,000 addresses

- **Data Analysis (R):**  
  Extract insights from the bank agencies dataset

- **Mapping (Mapbox GL JS):**  
  Create from scratch a map with a time slider to allow interactivity while viewing the time series

- **Data Visualization (Datawrapper+Illustrator+d3):**  
  Illustrate the news story with more data following a color palette and visual standard

- **Presentation (HTML/CSS):**  
  Create a webpage with the storytelling that is mobile responsive
